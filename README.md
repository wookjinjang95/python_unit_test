# QA_Test_Engineer_Assignment

1. What is your favorite test framework and why?

    My favorite test framework is data-driven framework because it requires less amount of code to generate. I believe that
    unit test should be simple and reduced generated code so that you can test faster and much simpler. It also offers great
    flexibility.

2. Given the following sample_account.py (see source code in repo), please write a unit test suite for the class.

    The code is in this directory.

3. Set up your unit test suite on github and travis CI.

    \\Done in the travis CI.
